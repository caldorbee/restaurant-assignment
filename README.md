# Group Project

The point of this to have fun and to work together with your team. Below is a "writeup" from a client about what they are looking for. Even though "they" get pretty specific, you still have a lot of liberty with this so long as you get all of the required pieces in place.

All in all, have fun... work hard... learn much.

> Note: All the mockups are [here](mockupRestaurant.jpg)

## Deliverables

Your task is to create a clean one page website that gives our customers as much info about us as possible. The following are required:

- A new logo
- A picture of the inside of our restaurant
- A feed from our online blog (provided)
- Our daily special (provided)
- A Google map with our address and phone number listed
- History of our business (make something up) :)
- Our menu (provided)
- Pictures of our food
- Ability to take reservations (fake backend, but show something visual)

## Design

We have provided you with a rough mockup of what we want our site to look like and on the second page of this summary we have listed how we expect each area to operate. We do however trust that you are the expert and will lean towards your decisions to create an amazing website for us.

## Wireframe Breakdown

1. We currently do not have a logo. We are not looking for anything fancy but would like it to look professional. This can be just some plain stylized text or you could use The Noun Project to pull an icon out of to add a little extra to the page.
2. We currently have a Facebook page, Twitter account, Instagram Account and are registered at Open Table. Please include icons for all of those. Don’t worry about the links to our pages, we can fill those in later.
3. This image should be a picture of the inside of our restaurant. You should be able to find a nice one on Flickr’s website. Make sure you have an appropriate license to use it.
4. This is our latest news. This will be pulled in from an API that we will provide for you. Keep in mind this will change frequently so make sure to account for spacing. You will probably need to trim the paragraph down and add a “Read More” link at the bottom that links out to our blog. We will fill in the blog link later.
5. We change our our specials each day. Again this will come from an API and will change daily. The API only includes the name, description and price so you will need to grab a generic image from Flickr.
6. This should be a Google Map and include our address (1112 S Casino Center Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89104)
7. Our menu is broken up into three categories. Since we only serve dinner that is all you need to worry about but you'll need to pull in appetizers, main courses and a la cart items individually. Again, this can all be pulled from our API.
8. We would like more food photos to show up as well. Again you can pull from Flickr.

## Menu Item Info Blocks

Each of our food items has special notes on it and if a note matches then the icon should be displayed. We are not worried what the icons look like as long as they portray the point across. Also there is a hover state that will need to show basic information about the note. This will be the same for all items and here is a breakdown of that.

- Allergy Info \* This item may contain shellfish or another item that some people may be allergic to.
  Please ask your waiter or waitress for assistance.
- Restaurant Favorite
  - We have been doing this a long time and this item has become one of our favorites.
- Spicy
  - This item is spicy, please handle with care and drink lots of water.
- Vegan
  - This item contains no meat and has been prepared without the use of animal products.
